# Jump Start with Ethereum and React

### Developed for NYC Blockchain Hack - 2018-03-31

## Prerequisites

* [Atom Text Editor](https://atom.io) (Or other text editor of your choice)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
  * [with test ether](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)
* [Heroku](https://heroku.com)

## Steps

### Setup Project and Install Dependencies

```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my_app
cd my_app
npm install --save web3@1.0.0-beta.26
atom .
```

### Create web3.js File

web3.js will serve as the communications layer to Ethereum.

Inside get_started/src folder, create a new file named "web3.js"

Use the following code. It grabs the provider from MetaMask using "window.web3.currentProvider" and creates an instance of web3 using our installed version (1.0.0-beta.26).

```
import Web3 from "web3";

const web3 = new Web3(window.web3.currentProvider);

export default web3;
```

### Create lottery.js file

lottery.js will provide an operational contract interface to our React application.

Inside get_started/src folder, create a new file named "lottery.js"

Use the following code, and then we will paste the abi and address from Remix into this file.

```
import web3 from "./web3";

const address = " <... paste from remix...> ";

const abi = [ <... paste from remix ...> ];

export default new web3.eth.Contract(abi, address);
```

### Deploy Smart Contract in Remix and Connect lottery.js

Go to http://remix.ethereum.org.

Paste the following code from the Lottery contract into Remix.

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.21;

contract Lottery {
    address public manager;
    address[] public players;

    function Lottery () public {
        manager = msg.sender;
    }

    function enter () public payable {

        // emphasize the use of "ether" keyword
        require (msg.value > 0.01 ether);

        // emphasize 'payable' function type
        players.push (msg.sender);
    }

    // select a psuedo-random number
    function random () private view returns (uint) {
        return uint(keccak256(block.difficulty, now, players));
    }

    function pickWinner () public {
        // only the manager should be allowed to call
        require (manager == msg.sender);

        uint index = random () % players.length;
        players[index].transfer (address(this).balance);

        // reset players so that the lottery can be run again
        players = new address[](0);
    }

    function getPlayers () public view returns (address[]) {
        return players;
    }
}
```

Click on "Start to Compile" and ensure that the "Lottery" shows in a green box.

![Remix compilation](img/remix_compilation.png")

Ensure rinkeby is selected and click create

![Rinkeby and click create](img/rinkeby_and_click_create.png)

MetaMask will pop up. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask.

Click copy icon to copy contract address to clipboard.
![Copy address](img/copy_icon_for_addr.png)

Paste the contract address into the lottery.js file.

On the Compile tab, click the Details button and then copy the ABI by clicking the copy button.

![Click the details button](img/click_details.png)

![Copy abi](img/copy_abi.png)

Paste the ABI into the lottery.js file.

### Construct src/App.js

src/App.js has the React Component code

For an initial test, you can change this line:

```
<h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
```

To this line:

```
<h1 className="App-title">Welcome to My Application</h1>
```

Then run

```
npm run start
```

and ensure that the title is updated.

Add imports to App.js

```
import web3 from "./web3";
import lottery from "./lottery";
```

Add a state object to the App class to store values from our lottery contract.

```
class App extends Component {
  state = {
    manager: "",
    players: "",
    balance: "",
    value: "",
    message: ""
  };
...
...
```

In React, the "componentDidMount()" method is the place to put code that queries data and saves that data to the state object. Add the following componentDidMount() method.

```
async componentDidMount() {

    const manager = await lottery.methods.manager().call();
    const players = await lottery.methods.getPlayers().call();
    const balance = await web3.eth.getBalance(lottery.options.address);

    this.setState({ manager, players, balance });
  }
```

Add an onSubmit method that we'll use for players to enter the lottery.

```
onSubmit = async event => {
    // prevents normal form submission
    event.preventDefault();

    const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();

    // put this in a bit later
    this.setState({ message: "Waiting on transaction success..." });

    await lottery.methods.enter().send({
      from: accounts[0],
      value: web3.utils.toWei(this.state.value, "ether")
    });

    // put this in a bit later
    this.setState({ message: "You have been entered!" });
  };
```

Add an onClick method that we'll use to pick the winner for our lottery.

```
onClick = async event => {
    const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();

    this.setState({ message: "Waiting on transaction success..." });

    console.log(
      await lottery.methods.pickWinner().send({
        from: accounts[0]
      })
    );

    this.setState({ message: "Winner has been picked!" });
  };
```

Update the render method to show the correct visualizations and form elements.

```
render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Lottery Contract</h2>
        <p>
          This contract is managed by {this.state.manager}. There are{" "}
          {this.state.players.length} people entered, competing to win{" "}
          {web3.utils.fromWei(this.state.balance, "ether")} ether!
        </p>
        <hr />

        <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
          <h4>Want to try your luck?</h4>
          <div>
            <label>Amount of ether to enter</label>
            <input
              value={this.state.value}
              onChange={event => this.setState({ value: event.target.value })}
            />
          </div>
          <button>Enter</button>
        </form>
        <hr />
        <h4>Ready to pick a winner?</h4>
        <button onClick={this.onClick}>Pick a winner</button>
        <hr />
        <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
```

If it isn't running already, start your react app with

```
npm run start
```

Your lottery interface should look like this:

### Deploy to Heroku

With a heroku account, the command line tools installed, and ssh enabled, run the followign commands::

```
heroku login
heroku create
```

Note the app name assigned by heroku.

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
heroku git:remote -a <app-name>
git push heroku master
heroku open
```
